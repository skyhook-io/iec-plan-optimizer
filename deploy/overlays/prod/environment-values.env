# Environment-specific configuration values loaded into the environment-values ConfigMap.
# These values are used by Kustomize replacements to inject environment-specific data at build time.
# Alternative approach: Use overlay-specific patches in deploy/overlays/<env>/patches/.
#
# Users typically set per environment:
# - INGRESS_HOST=myservice.example.com (hostname for this environment)
# - NAMESPACE=production (for ephemeral environments only)
#
# Auto-generated values (rarely need modification):
# - INGRESS_TLS_SECRET_NAME=iec-plan-optimizer-tls-cert (only change if using custom TLS setup)
#
# Format: KEY=value (standard env file format)
